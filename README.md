# ICA8

In this problem we have to return the maximum of free urinal. There's an unwritten rule that you have to leave one urinal free between you and the next person beside you. So we have to return the maximum of free urinals according to this unwritten rule. For example 00000 should return 3 as it can be fitted as 10101
